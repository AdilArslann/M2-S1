## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

In response to the request from our Project Manager, Owen Overbudget, we've added four pages to the travel agency website while maintaining the same visual style and user experience. Let's explore the pages!

## Pages <a name="pages"></a>

### Main Page <a name="main-page"></a>

The Main Page showcases the four most popular destinations with some details. It serves as the central hub for users to explore other pages. This page has a header and footer.

### Destinations Gallery <a name="destinations-gallery"></a>

The Destinations Gallery Page displays a gallery of 12 destination images. The first item in the gallery links to the Individual Destination Page and visually changes on hover to indicate clickability. This page has a header and footer.

### Individual Destination Page <a name="individual-destination-page"></a>

The Individual Destination Page presents a single destination image, a 3-paragraph description, and a form to book a trip to that destination, similar to the form on the landing page. It includes a link back to the Destinations Gallery Page. This page has a header but no footer.

### Contact Us Form Page <a name="contact-us-form-page"></a>

The Contact Us Form Page allows users to submit inquiries to the travel agency. It includes fields for name, email, phone number, and a message textarea. All fields are required before the form can be submitted. A submit button directs the user to the Contact Form Success Page. This page has a header but no footer.

### Contact Form Success Page <a name="contact-form-success-page"></a>

The Contact Form Success Page is displayed upon submission of the contact form, thanking the user for their inquiry. It includes a link back to the Homepage. This page has a header but no footer.
